# Pneumonia Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **automated detection of pneumonia** from chest X-ray images using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Transfer Learning** with **ResNet50**.

**Goal**: Build models that accurately distinguish between **NORMAL** and **PNEUMONIA** chest X-rays, supporting medical diagnostics and reducing radiologists' workload.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Chest X-ray dataset (5,863 labeled images)
- **Classes**: `NORMAL`, `PNEUMONIA`
- **Dataset**: [Chest X-Ray Pneumonia (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

### Data Split
- **Training**: 70%  
- **Validation**: 15%  
- **Test**: 15%  

### Data Augmentation

Applied using `Keras.ImageDataGenerator`:
- Random rotation
- Width/height shift
- Zoom
- Brightness adjustment
- Horizontal flipping

## Models

Three different models were developed and compared:

### CNN (From Scratch)
### Transfer Learning â€“ ResNet50
### Fine-Tuned ResNet50
